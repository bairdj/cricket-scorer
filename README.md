This is a small cricket scoring application written in C primarily to practise using C.

It works simply by prompting the user for the outcome of each ball. The user simple enters the
number of runs scored on each ball, which will then increment the team and batsman's score.

There are a few special inputs handled by the program:
* x: Exits the program
* .: Equivalent to 0 - a *dot ball*
* s: Prints a scorecard
